## 🔴 Must do before sharing publicly

- [ ] Run BFG to scrub `.env` from git history, then rotate all keys
- [ ] `wrangler secret put` for ADMIN_TOKEN, WEBHOOK_URL
- [x] Validate external API responses before parsing — `safeJson<T>(res, guard, label)` in `lib/results.ts`; all 10 source files updated; malformed upstream → `status: 'error'`, never a crash or bad cache write

---

## 🟡 Performance — one live problem, two quick wins

### NVD latency (live problem)
- [x] Batch CVE requests 5 at a time — `fetchCVEsBatched()` in `worker/lookup.ts` cuts enrichment time ~5× for CVE-heavy hosts.
- [x] Stream Layer 1+2 results immediately — `VulnsStream` client component fetches via `GET /api/stream` (NDJSON); geo/ports/threats/certs SSR in <1s, CVE card shows pulsing skeleton then patches in when NVD responds. `lib/useHostStream.ts` for reuse.

### Blocklists (quick win)
- [ ] Move Feodo and SSLBL into D1 tables with an index on IP/SHA1 — replace the current in-memory linear scan with a single indexed `SELECT`. One migration script.

---

## 🟢 Features users actually want

### Copy individual field values
- [x] Copy button on every data field — one click copies the value. IP, ASN number, CVE ID, domain, certificate fingerprint.

### Shareable result links
- [x] Share button — copies the `/host/<query>` URL; falls back to Web Share API on mobile.

### Saved targets + change alerts
- [x] Save any host from the results page — `SaveButton` → `POST /api/targets` → D1 upsert.
- [x] `GET /api/targets` — list all saved targets.
- [x] `DELETE /api/targets/:id` — remove a target.
- [x] Daily cron — `worker/cron.ts` re-queries all targets, diffs ports/CVEs/threat hits, persists snapshot.
- [x] Email or webhook notification on change — POST to `WEBHOOK_URL` env var; payload `{ sentAt, events[] }` dispatched via `ctx.waitUntil` after each cron sweep.

### Batch lookup
- [x] `POST /api/batch` — up to 20 queries, all in parallel, partial failures isolated per-item.
- [x] Rate limit charges the full batch cost in one atomic KV write.

### CVE detail on click
- [x] Clicking a CVE ID in the results page opens a drawer with description, CVSS scores, CWEs, references.

## ❌ Not building

| Item | Why not |
|---|---|
| Network graph for BGP relationships | BGPView already has one — link out |
| WebSocket live updates | SSE + streaming covers the actual need |
| CIDR range expansion | Add after batch lookup ships |
| Drag-and-drop result layout | No real user need |
| RSS feed | Webhooks are what security teams actually use |
| Bloom filter for blocklists | D1 indexed lookup is simpler and fast enough |
| Grafana dashboard | Cloudflare Analytics covers it |
